# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- **Windows platform support**: Full support for Windows build and release (thanks @jrtxio [PR#6](https://github.com/qufei1993/skills-hub/pull/6)).
- Support and display for many new tools (e.g., Kimi Code CLI, Augment, OpenClaw, Cline, CodeBuddy, Command Code, Continue, Crush, Junie, iFlow CLI, Kiro CLI, Kode, MCPJam, Mistral Vibe, Mux, OpenClaude IDE, OpenHands, Pi, Qoder, Qwen Code, Trae/Trae CN, Zencoder, Neovate, Pochi, AdaL).
- UI confirmation and linked selection for tools that share the same global skills directory.
- Local import multi-skill discovery aligned with Git rules, with a selection list and invalid-item reasons.
- New local import commands for listing candidates and installing a selected subpath with SKILL.md validation.

### Changed
- Antigravity global skills directory updated to `~/.gemini/antigravity/global_skills`.
- OpenCode global skills directory corrected to `~/.config/opencode/skills`.
- Tool status now includes `skills_dir`; frontend tool list/sync is driven by backend data and deduped by directory.
- Sync/unsync now updates records across tools sharing a skills directory to avoid duplicate filesystem work and inconsistent state.
- Local import flow now scans candidates first; single valid candidate installs directly, multi-candidate opens selection.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-01-26

### Changed
- GitHub Actions release workflow for macOS packaging and uploading `updater.json` (`.github/workflows/release.yml`).
- Cursor sync now always uses directory copy due to Cursor not following symlinks when discovering skills: https://forum.cursor.com/t/cursor-doesnt-follow-symlinks-to-discover-skills/149693/4
- Managed skill update now re-syncs copy-mode targets using copy-only overwrite, and forces Cursor targets to copy to avoid accidental relinking.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-25

### Added
- Initial release of SkillLoom desktop app (Tauri + React).
- Central repository for Skills; sync to multiple AI coding tools (symlink/junction preferred, copy fallback).
- Local import from folders.
- Git import via repository URL or folder URL (`/tree/<branch>/<path>`), with multi-skill selection and batch install.
- Sync and update: copy-mode targets can be refreshed; managed skills can be updated from source.
- Migration intake: scan existing tool directories, import into central repo, and one‑click sync.
- New tool detection and optional sync.
- Basic settings: storage path, language, and theme.
- Git cache with cleanup (days) and freshness window (seconds).

### Build & Release
- Local packaging scripts for macOS (dmg), Windows (msi/nsis), Linux (deb/appimage).
- GitHub Actions build validation and tag-based draft releases (release notes pulled from `CHANGELOG.md`).

### Performance
- Git import and batch install optimizations: cached clones reduce repeated fetches; timeouts and non‑interactive git improve stability.
